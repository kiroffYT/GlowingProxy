# A few details about myself
Hello everyone in this repository!
My name is Kirill, I am from Russia, I am 16 years old, and at the moment I am actively trying to learn the Python programming language.
And I decided - what if we create a simple, but at the same time, a multifunctional Python program for finding working proxy servers?
Actually, I'm actively doing it now, and I'm ready to spoil something for you - in the program it will be possible to choose the language in which it is most convenient for you to work.

I will announce one more information - two editions will be released for the program: free and Pro.

# About the program
Unique proxy server generator coming soon: **GlowingProxy**
There will be two variations of the program - **Free** and **Pro**

## Free version features:
• Search proxy servers only in the following countries (Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, USA, Germany, France, Armenia, Poland, Italy, Spain and UK)
• No more than 500 proxy servers per check
• Inability to check proxy servers from a file

## Pro version features:
• Search for proxy servers in any available countries
• Up to an infinite number of proxy servers in one check
• Ability to check proxy servers from a file
• Unique Pro-key, with a complex algorithm for its creation

Free version price: *free*
Pro version price: *$5 forever*

# Little problem...
But since, as I said above, I am from Russia, and this country is now subject to sanctions (which, to some extent, is tragic), then most likely, either I will have to master the electronic wallets of your countries and try to make sure that I was able to fully use them, or you will already have to download the Russian VPN and master the YooMoney electronic wallet. (and most likely the first)

**There is no program here yet, but it will be in this repository soon :)**
